This directory should contain all toplevel applications that
are created. Each of these applications should define their
own main function which will be called at initialization.

When adding a new application, CMakeLists.txt file should be
updated with a new entry pointing to the new subdirectory.
An example is already provided for the sample application.

All applications must define the following c function:

int main(void)

The intialization code will invoke main and this is the
main entry point to the application. Most applications
will run in a FreeRTOS envrionment and will simply
use freertos-sample as an example to build from. If you
know what you're doing you can build an image without
FreeRTOS support. Appropriate linker files are found
in bsp/ directory.
